Home

This page is where every user goes when opening the application for regular users it should show a carousel with three changing games and a navigation strip at the top of the page. Admins get a special page with navigation to their menus.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All games

This page shows all games in the system spread across pages. The user has several options to filter games such as filtering by: genre and keyword. As well as different ordering settings to choose from. From here they can also access the details page of every game by pressing the "Details" button. The "All games" and "Details" pages are the only ones an unregistered user can access. Developers and admins can edit and delete games straight from this page (provided that the developer is the one who published the game, admins can edit and delete every game).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Details (Game)

Here the user can see additional information about the game such as its description and the developer's user name and business address. Developers and admins can delete and edit games from this page as well (same limitations apply to the developer as on the "All games page").

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discover

This page picks at random three games for the user to view and maybe try out. If the user is a developer the games on the page will not contain any of the games that developer has published.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guides

This page is similar to the "All games" page where users can search for guides on any game (no matter if the game is registered in the applications database). Users again have filtering options and from here they have the ability to write a guide of their own (every user with an account can write a guide).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Details(Guide)

The "Details" page for guides allows users to read the whole content of the guide.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to note when working with the app

The database doesn't come seeded so for testing you would need to add a couple of entities yourself
